How do I want to control motor speed from computer end?

I send a command like: motor_right.setSpeed()
It will set the motor speed to that value, and the arduino will latch onto it and run the motors at that speed until it receives a new command

I could also send a command like: motor_right.slew(True)
This starts a daemon thread that runs parallel to the main program. Whenever you call motor_right.setSpeed(),
    it sets the desired speed to that value and slowly accelerates to it.

You can turn it off with motor_right.slew(False)


I found out that I can only control one motor at a time because the two motor slew
threads running at the same time sent jumbled information to the arduino.
